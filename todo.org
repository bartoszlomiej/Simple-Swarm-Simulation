* Majors:
  Only necesities will be listed here

** DONE Improved collisions
   Robots should move in the random direction after collision (but it should be restricted angle
   -> at most 90 degrees between the point of collision)

** DONE AS improval - if no other member of AS is visible -> create new AS
   Important -> removes the robots that are outside of the given AS

** TODO Timers
   Sth here

*** TODO Does # of neighbors change?
    Check periodically number of neighbors
   
*** TODO Aggregation changes
    there must be some switch off (after the transition to phase 2 occurs)
    
*** TODO Further work

* Minors:
  Optional todos

** TODO All collisions should be smooth

** TODO Make the change of speed easy to change
   after stop speed must be multiplied as initially given
   
*** Other notes:
  Changing phase of work
  [-] Border robot indication
    [-] Remember to make them resistant to "free electrons" -> the neighbor is a robot that don't move!
  [-] Timer implementation
    [-] Adjusting AS ID to be ready to become counter
    [-] Prove that given counter is not random -> make it reasonable
  [-] Broadcast phase change
    [-] Show the result (eg. change shape to triangle)

  Notation used:
  AS - autonomus system -> represents the cluster of robots
